# Push_swap
A proyect about sorting amounts of numbers which are in a stack. This proyect aims to develop the best sorting algorithm based in strict norms.

To understand the norms check the subject in the link below:

Now, do "make" to compile the proyect. If you want to see the movements do "make exe" and the Makefile will generate 500 numbers that are passed through argument.
Then a lot of commands will be displayed. But I did a _checker_ so you can know if the executable really sorts well. Do "make bonus" and then "make test". Ok shoul be displayed.
